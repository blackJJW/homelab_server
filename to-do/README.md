# Homelab Server and Project To-Do List

## 1. Automation
- [ ] Set up `cron` jobs to automate tasks:
  - [ ] Schedule `update_upgrade.sh` to run weekly.
  - [ ] Schedule `backup.sh` to run daily.
- [ ] Create a systemd timer as an alternative to `cron`.

## 2. Documentation
- [ ] Add a `/docs` folder to the repository.
- [ ] Create detailed documentation:
  - [ ] Network diagram.
  - [ ] Service architecture overview.
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues.
  - [ ] Documentation for each script (purpose, usage, parameters).
  
## 3. Monitoring and Alerts
- [ ] Set up Prometheus for metrics collection.
- [ ] Configure Grafana for server health dashboards.
- [ ] Set up alerting (e.g., email or Slack) for critical thresholds:
  - [ ] Low disk space.
  - [ ] High CPU or memory usage.

## 4. Security
- [ ] Configure a VPN (e.g., WireGuard or Tailscale) for remote access.
- [ ] Harden SSH:
  - [ ] Disable password-based login.
  - [ ] Set up SSH key-based authentication.
  - [ ] Enable Fail2Ban for brute-force attack prevention.
- [ ] Set up a firewall with `UFW`:
  - [ ] Allow necessary ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443).
  - [ ] Block unused ports.

## 5. Backup and Recovery
- [ ] Create a backup strategy:
  - [ ] Use `rsync` or `BorgBackup` for automated backups.
  - [ ] Store backups locally and on cloud storage.
- [ ] Test backup and recovery process.

## 6. Networking and Access
- [ ] Configure Dynamic DNS (e.g., DuckDNS or No-IP) for external access.
- [ ] Set up a reverse proxy with SSL:
  - [ ] Use Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy for hosting multiple services.

## 7. Service Management
- [ ] Use Docker Compose to manage containerized services:
  - [ ] Deploy a sample service (e.g., Nextcloud or Plex).
  - [ ] Document Docker Compose configuration.
- [ ] Configure databases:
  - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL or MySQL.
  - [ ] Create backup scripts for databases.

## 8. Infrastructure and Scaling
- [ ] Experiment with virtualization:
  - [ ] Use Proxmox or VMware ESXi for managing VMs.
- [ ] Plan for scaling:
  - [ ] Add additional storage or RAM as needed.
  - [ ] Experiment with clustering tools like Kubernetes.

## 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Monitor resource usage regularly:
  - [ ] Set up dashboards in Grafana for CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- [ ] Implement caching with Redis or Memcached for improved performance.
- [ ] Configure load balancing with HAProxy or Nginx.

## 10. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all scripts to ensure they work as expected.
- [ ] Verify backups by performing a full recovery test.
- [ ] Run a vulnerability scan with tools like `Nmap` or `Lynis`.

## 11. Collaboration
- [ ] Use GitHub Issues or Projects for task management.
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automation:
  - [ ] Automate testing of scripts.
  - [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines for services.
